<p>I got tired of finding recipes with a million ingredients and utensils I didn't have. Eg. cast iron skillet, copper pot, gruyere cheese, whaat? I don't have that stuff. I wanted an app where I could search for stuff like salt, pepper, chicken and onions? Capiche?  Go to the <a href='index.html'>Home Page</a> and check it out.
